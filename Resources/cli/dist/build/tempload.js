1. Safari → Settings → Advanced → check "Show features for web developers".
2. Safari → Settings → Developer → check "Allow Unsigned Extensions"
   (enter your macOS password; this resets every time Safari restarts).
3. Develop menu → "Add Temporary Extension…".
4. Select this folder:
   ${stagedDir}
5. Enable the extension in Safari → Settings → Extensions.

Notes:
- Temporary extensions must be re-added after each Safari restart.
- No code signing or Xcode build required — ideal for rapid iteration.
